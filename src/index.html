	<h2>THRIFT SHOP</h2>
	<p>With secondhand and vintage now increasingly accessible, 
		consider buying pre-loved items when looking to add to your wardrobe. 
		Not only will you extend the life of these garments and reduce the environmental 
		impact of your wardrobe as a result, you can also find one-of-a-kind pieces that 
		no one else will own.</p>
	<h2>BUY FROM ECO-FRIENDLY STORES</h2>
	<p>Buying better can also mean supporting designers who are promoting sustainable 
		practices Narrowing your search for specific items can also help, 
		whether that is seeking out brands producing activewear more sustainably.</p>
	<h2>TRY RENTING</h2>
	<p>Instead of buying a new dress for that wedding or BBQ this summer 
		(COVID restrictions permitting, of course), it is now easier than 
		ever to rent something to wear instead. </p>
	<h2>REDUCE WATER FOOTPRINT</h2>
	<p>Given that the production of textile uses an astonishing 93bn cubic 
		metres of water annually — the equivalent to 37m Olympic swimming 
		pools—we should all be more conscious about the water footprint of 
		our clothes.</p>
