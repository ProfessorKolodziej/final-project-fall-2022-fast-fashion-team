            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> Welcome to our website on sustianable fashion and eco-friendly clothing. In the last couple of years, fast-fashion has been on the rise where many people are buying clothes made from cheap material and produced by child labor. Most of these online retailers offer clothing at a an affordabe price that comes with a cost: they are not long lasting and are not sustaniable. Here we want to educate you on how to stop buying fast-fashion and find alternative ways to buy clothing this is safe for the environment. You will learn about different fabrics, sustainable ways to shop, resources to use and how you can personally make a difference. </p>

		<h2>THRIFT SHOP</h2>
		<p>With secondhand and vintage now increasingly accessible, 
			consider buying pre-loved items when looking to add to your wardrobe. 
			Not only will you extend the life of these garments and reduce the environmental 
			impact of your wardrobe as a result, you can also find one-of-a-kind pieces that 
			no one else will own.</p>
		<h2>BUY FROM ECO-FRIENDLY STORES</h2>
		<p>Buying better can also mean supporting designers who are promoting sustainable 
			practices Narrowing your search for specific items can also help, 
			whether that is seeking out brands producing activewear more sustainably.</p>
		<h2>TRY RENTING</h2>
		<p>Instead of buying a new dress for that wedding or BBQ this summer 
			(COVID restrictions permitting, of course), it is now easier than 
			ever to rent something to wear instead. </p>
		<h2>REDUCE WATER FOOTPRINT</h2>
		<p>Given that the production of textile uses an astonishing 93bn cubic 
			metres of water annually — the equivalent to 37m Olympic swimming 
			pools—we should all be more conscious about the water footprint of 
			our clothes.</p>
