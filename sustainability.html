Not only will you extend the life of these garments and reduce the environmental impact of your wardrobe as a result, you can also find one-of-a-kind pieces that no one else will own.</p><h2>BUY FROM ECO-FRIENDLY STORES</h2><p>Buying better can also mean supporting designers who are promoting sustainable practices Narrowing your search for specific items can also help, whether that is seeking out brands producing activewear more sustainably.</p><h2>TRY RENTING</h2><p>Instead of buying a new dress for that wedding or BBQ this summer (COVID restrictions permitting, of course), it is now easier than ever to rent something to wear instead.</p><h2>REDUCE WATER FOOTPRINT</h2><p>Given that the production of textile uses an astonishing 93bn cubic metres of water annually — the equivalent to 37m Olympic swimming pools—we should all be more conscious about the water footprint of our clothes.</p></div><div class="sustainabilityfact"><h3>Did you know the average person only wears <b>20%</b> of their clothes <b>80%</b> of the time?</h3></div></body></html>
